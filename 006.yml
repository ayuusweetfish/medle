  title: 永远同在（いつも何度でも）

    宫崎骏执导的 2001 年动画电影《千与千寻》片尾曲，电影中惟一一首不是久石让创作的作品。
    创作歌手木村弓因宫崎骏的作品《幽灵公主》深受触动，通过书信联系了宫崎骏，并得到参与创作下一部电影《画烟囱的小玲》配乐的邀请，木村弓由此创作了歌曲《永远同在》。后来《画烟囱的小玲》终止制作，但是歌曲却被保留到了新作《千与千寻》中。宫崎骏曾言，或许正是这首歌曲激发了创作《千与千寻》的灵感。

  title: Always With Me (いつも何度でも)

    Ending theme of the 2001 animation film "Spirited Away", directed by Miyazaki Hayao. This is the only piece of music in the film not written by Hisaishi Joe.
    The singer-songwriter Kimura Yumi, deeply moved by Miyazaki's work "Princess Mononoke", contacted Miyazaki by letter and was invited to compose for the next film "Rin the Chimney Painter", for which Kimura wrote the song "Always With Me". Production of the film was later ceased, but the song was kept for the new film "Spirited Away". Miyazaki has hinted that it was probably the song that inspired the story of "Spirited Away".
